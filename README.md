### Time Complexity.  What is it?
How does the performance of your code scale based on the size of your inputs?

```
animals = ['bird', 'cat', 'fish']

O(1) means that it takes a constant time, like 14 nanoseconds, or three minutes no matter the amount of data in the set. O(n) means it takes an amount of time linear with the size of the set, so a set twice the size will take twice the time.

# Return the name of all animals
def getAnimals();
  return animals

```

```
animals = ['bird', 'cat', 'fish']

O(n) means it takes an amount of time linear with the size of the set, so a set twice the size will take twice the time.

  return animals
